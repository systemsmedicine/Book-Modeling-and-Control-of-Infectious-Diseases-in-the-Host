## Introduction

Modeling and Control of Infectious Diseases in The Host is an invaluable resource for researchers working in theoretical immunology, 
mathematical epidemiology, modeling, and biomathematics, as well as graduate students working in mathematical modelling in biology. 
Illustrative examples for parameter fitting, modeling and control applications are explained with its corresponding programming 
code using the software MATLAB and R.
